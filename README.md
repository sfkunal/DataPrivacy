# DataPrivacy
The world of technology is changing. It used to be one where users could post on social media, order clothes online, and play mobile games without a care in the world. As time progressed, companies eventually realized that they could collect small pieces of information from a user’s technological habits, and use that to form a profile of the user of some sort. I used a packet-monitoring service to listen in on third-party applications and wrote a script to filter out relevant pieces of data that were being sent back to an application’s server. The findings of this study concluded that third-party iOS applications have unmonitored power to access pieces of information like contacts, location, and emails.
